Looking at NYC bike sharing to apply to Des Moines. 
## Overview
Customer saw bike sharing in use in NYC and wanted to evaluate the NYC model to see if bike sharing could be used in Des Moines. Software used was Python and Tableau.  The data was imported and the Tripduration datatype was adjusted from an interger to a datetime datatype using Python.  Tahleau was used to create all of the charts to tell the story of the NYC model Data.

When viewing the Story of Bike Usage in NYC it starts out showing where the bikes start their journeys.  The next page shows the bikes overall usage.  The story then covers the rider's time duration with the bike.

We then cover the checkout times by gender and see that males usually has the bike for a much longer duration.

We review the usage by weekday and see that Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Fridays are mainly used during rush hours. This shows that the bikes are used to commute to and from work. Saturday and Sunday are another time that the bikes are used but between the rush hours times.

We review the usage by gendor and again see that the males use the bikes the most.  This chart also reflect the days usage as in the previous chart.

We then review the usage by gendor and by weekday and see that the customer uses the bikes the most on the weekends and the subscribers use the bikes the most during the weekdays.

## Summary
The data shows that the bikes are used regularly on a weekly basis.  They appear to be a main transport for communiters that live in town.  Other customers use the bikes to get around on the weekends.  The overall proposal looks to be faverable for Des Moines to copy.  It is suggested that Des Moines evaluate their downtown population to see how people commute to and from work downtown.  Another item that they need to evaluate in this decision is the weather.  The winters in Des Moines are more extream than those in NYC.  The worse winters may make the winter months to be times the bikes are not used.
